\chapter{Docker Penetration Test Checklist}\label{chapter:checklist}
In \autoref{chapter:vulnerabilities} and \autoref{chapter:pentesting} we looked at common vulnerabilities and how to identify them. In this chapter we will summarize those into a checklist consisting of questions. These are questions a penetration tester should ask themselves when assessing a container or a host. Steps on how to answer each question are also given.

Secura explicitly asked for this list to be added, to make it easier for penetration testers to use this thesis during an assessment.

This list is kept intentionally short and uses only Unix shell commands that can be run manually, to make it easy and quick to use.

\medskip

In \autoref{section:tools} we look at tools help automating certain enumeration or exploitation of vulnerabilities. Most of these require some setup (e.g.\ installing dependency libraries) and only cover specific vulnerabilities. This goes exactly against the purpose of this checklist and as such are not necessary to use this checklist (with the notable exception of Docker Bench for Security).

\medskip

The first section is meant to detect whether we are running inside a container (\autoref{section:checklist-detection}). If we know we are inside a container, we can look for vulnerabilities inside the container (see \autoref{section:checklist-vulnerabilities-container}). If we know we are not running inside a container, we can look for vulnerabilities on the host (see \autoref{section:checklist-vulnerabilities-host}).
