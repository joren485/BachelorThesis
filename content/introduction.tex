\chapter{Introduction}
Secura, a company specializing in digital security, performs security assessments for clients. In these assessments, Secura evaluates the private and public networks of their clients. They would like to improve those assessments by also looking into containerization software their clients may be running.

Containerization software allows developers to package software into easily reproducible packages. It removes the tedious process of installing the right dependencies to run software, because the dependencies and necessary files are neatly isolated in the container. These containers run isolated from each other and the host they run on.

\hfill

This thesis will focus on the de facto industry standard for containerization software, Docker. It will focus on Linux, because Docker is developed for Linux (although a Windows version does exist\footnote{Docker on Windows actually runs inside a Linux virtual machine.}). Throughout this thesis we will look at practical examples, so a good understanding of Linux the is recommended.

We will first look at some notations (\autoref{chapter:notation}) and the necessary background information (\autoref{chapter:background}). We will then go into more detail about the attack surface (\autoref{section:attack-surface-models}), misconfigurations (\autoref{section:misconfigurations}) and specific security related bugs (\autoref{section:bugs}). Finally, we will describe how these can be used during a penetration test (\autoref{chapter:pentesting}) and which tools might be useful to automate part of the process (\autoref{section:tools}).
