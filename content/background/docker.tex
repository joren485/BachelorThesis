The concept of containerization has been around a long time, but it only gained traction as serious way to package, distribute and run software in the last few years. This is mostly because of Docker.

\hfill

Docker was released in 2013 and it did not only offer a containerization platform, but also a way to distribute the containers. This allows developers and companies to create packages that are much more easily run.

\hfill

For example, someone that wants to run an instance of Wordpress (a very popular CMS), does not need to install all the Wordpress dependencies. They only need to download and run the Docker container.
Similarly, if they want to move the Wordpress instance from one host to the other, they just have to copy over the files and run the Docker image on the new machine.

\subsubsection{Docker Concepts}
Docker is based on three concepts: Docker images, Docker containers and \lstinline{Dockerfile}s.

\hfill

A Docker image is packaged software. It is a distributable file consisting of image layers.

\hfill

A container is an instance of a Docker Image. If you run software packaged as a Docker image, you create a container based on that image. If you want to run two instances of the same Docker image, you can create two containers.

\hfill

A \lstinline{Dockerfile} describes what a Docker image is made of. It describes the steps to create the image. Lets look at a very simple example:

\hfill

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Very Basic \lstinline{Dockerfile}},label={dockerfile:simple},captionpos=b]
FROM alpine:latest
LABEL maintainer="Joren Vrancken"
CMD ["echo", "Hello World"]
\end{lstlisting}

\hfill

These three instructions tell the Docker engine how to create a new Docker image.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The \lstinline{FROM} instruction tells the Docker engine what to base the new Docker image on. Instead of creating an image from scratch (a blank image), we use an already existing image as our basis.

    \item The \lstinline{LABEL} instruction sets a key value pair for the image. There can be multiple LABEL instructions. These key value pairs get packaged and distributed with the image.

    \item The \lstinline{CMD} instruction sets the default command that should be run and which arguments should be passed to it.
\end{enumerate}

The full instructionset can be found in the \lstinline{Dockerfile} reference\footnote{\url{https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/}}

\hfill

We can use this to create a new image and container from that image.
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Creating a Docker container from a \lstinline{Dockerfile}},label={docker:container},captionpos=b]
$ docker build -t thesis-hello-world .
$ docker run --rm --name=thesis-hello-world-container thesis-hello-world
\end{lstlisting}

We first create a Docker image (called \lstinline{thesis-hello-world}) using the \lstinline{docker build} command and then create and start a new container (called \lstinline{thesis-hello-world-container}) from that image.

\subsubsection{Data Persistence}

\subsubsection{Networking}
\todo[inline]{iptables}
\todo[inline]{\url{https://github.com/docker/libnetwork/blob/master/docs/design.md}}

When a Docker container is created Docker creates a network sandbox for that container and (by default) connects it to an internal bridge network. This gives the container its own networking resourcessuch as a IPv4 address\footnote{IPv6 support is not enabled by default.}, routes and DNS entries. All outgoing traffic is routed through a bridge interface (by default).

\hfill

Incoming traffic is possible by routing traffic for specific ports from the host to the container.
Specifying which ports on the host are routed to which ports on the container is done when a container is created.

If we, for example, want to expose port \lstinline{80} to the Docker image created from the \hyperref[dockerfile:simple]{first \lstinline{Dockerfile}} we can execute the following commands.

\hfill

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Creating a Docker container with exposed port},label={docker:publish},captionpos=b]
$ docker build -t thesis-hello-world .
$ docker run --rm --publish 8000:80 --name=thesis-hello-world-container thesis-hello-world
\end{lstlisting}

\hfill

We first create a Docker image using the \lstinline{Dockerfile} and then create (and start) a container from that image. We ``publish'' port \lstinline{8000} on the host to port \lstinline{80} of the container. This means that, while the container is running, all traffic from port \lstinline{8000} on the host is routed to port \lstinline{80} of the container.

\todo[inline]{Secrets in docker-compose can be easily found, even without docker group permissions}

\subsection{Registries}
\todo[inline]{Official images not always standard images}

Docker images are distributable through so called registries. A registry is a server (that anybody can host), that stores Docker images. When a client does not have a Docker image that it needs, it can contact a registry to download that image.

\hfill

The most popular (and public) registry is Docker Hub, which is run by company that develops Docker.
Anybody can create a Docker Hub account and start creating images that anybody can download. Docker Hub also provides default images for popular software.
