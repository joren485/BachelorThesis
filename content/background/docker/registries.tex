\subsection{Registries}
Docker images are distributable through registries. A registry is a server (that anybody can host), that stores Docker images. When a client does not have a Docker image that it needs, it can contact a registry to download that image. Note that because registries are an easy way to distribute Docker images, they are an interesting attack vector.

\medskip

The most popular (and default) registry is Docker Hub, which is run by the Docker company itself. Anybody can create a Docker Hub account and start creating and publishing images that anybody can download.
