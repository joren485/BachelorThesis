\section{Docker}\label{background:docker}
The concept of containerization has been around a long time\footnote{\url{https://docs.freebsd.org/44doc/papers/jail/jail-9.html}}, but it only gained traction as serious way to package, distribute and run software in the last few years. This is mostly because of Docker.

\medskip

Docker was released in 2013 and it does not only offer a containerization platform, but also a way to distribute the containers. This allows developers and organizations to create packages that have no dependencies (besides Docker itself, of course). This allows for a lot faster development and deployment processes, because dependencies and installation of software are no longer a concern.

\medskip

Docker also makes it possible to run multiple versions of the same software on the same host, without creating a dependency nightmare. For example, if someone wants to run a Wordpress 4 website and Wordpress 5 website, they only need to create two Wordpress containers. Because the containers are isolated from one another, their conflicting dependencies are not a problem.
