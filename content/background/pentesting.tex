\section{Penetration Testing}
Penetration testing (or pentesting) is an simulated attack to test the security and discover vulnerabilities in systems. The goal of a penetration test is to find the weak points in a system to be able to fix and secure them, before a malicious actor finds them.

\hfill

A penetration test consists of five steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Reconnaissance
    \item Exploitation
    \item Post-exploitation
    \item Exfiltration
    \item Clean Closure
\end{enumerate}
