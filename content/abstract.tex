\begin{abstract}
Containerization software has become extremely popular to streamline software deployments in the last few years. That has made it a very import attack surface. This paper looks at how one should go about testing the security of the Docker containers. It first looks at known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that impact the security. It links those to the Docker CIS Benchmark (security guidelines). It then provides a methodology for Secura to test the security of Dockers in the networks of their clients.
