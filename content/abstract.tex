Containerization software has become extremely popular to streamline software deployments in the last few years. That has made it a very important attack surface. This bachelor thesis looks at how one should go about testing the security of the Docker containers.

\hfill

We first look at multiple attack scenarios: escaping Docker containers, attacking the host through the Docker Daemon, attacks on containers and inter-container attacks. We then look at interesting and important CVEs (vulnerabilities). We also take a practical look at configurations mistakes that Docker users could make. We link the vulnerabilities and misconfigurations to Docker CIS Benchmarks, which are security guidelines aimed at Docker.

\hfill

Finally, we create a methodology to identify and use the vulnerabilities and misconfigurations we looked at in the different attack scenarios. Specifically, we look at how Secura could use them during their security assessments.
