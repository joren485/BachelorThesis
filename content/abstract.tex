Containerization software has become extremely popular to streamline software deployments in the last few years. Its popularity has made it a very important attack surface. This bachelor thesis looks at how someone should test the security of systems using Docker.

\medskip

We first look at multiple attack scenarios: escaping Docker containers, attacking the host through the Docker daemon and inter-container attacks. We then look at interesting and important vulnerabilities, both misconfigurations and software bugs. We take a practical look at configurations mistakes that Docker users could make. We also look at interesting CVEs (security related bugs) in Docker. We link these vulnerabilities to Docker CIS Benchmarks, which are security guidelines aimed at Docker.

\medskip

Finally, we look at how we identify and use the vulnerabilities we looked at. Specifically, we look at how we should identify and use vulnerabilities during security assessments.
