\subsection{CVE--2019--13139}
Older versions than Docker 18.09.4, had a bug were \lstinline{docker build} incorrectly parsed URLs, which allows code execution~\cite{CVE-2019-13139-STAALDRAAD}. The string supplied to \lstinline{docker build} is split on ``:'' and ``\#'' to parse the Git reference. By supplying a malicious URL, it is possible to achieve code execution.

\medskip

For example, in the following \lstinline{docker build} command, the command ``\lstinline{echo attack}'' is executed.

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={\lstinline{docker build} command execution.},captionpos=b]
(host)$ docker build "git@github.com/meh/meh#--upload-pack=echo attack;#:"
\end{lstlisting}

\lstinline{docker build} executes \lstinline{git fetch} in the background. But with the malicious command \lstinline{git fetch --upload-pack=echo attack; git@github.com/meh/meh} is executed, which in turn executes \lstinline{echo attack}.
