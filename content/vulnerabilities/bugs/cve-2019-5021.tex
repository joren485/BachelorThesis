\subsection{CVE--2019--5021}\label{subsection:CVE-2019-5021}
One of the most used base images (the Docker image for Alpine Linux) had a problem where the password of the \lstinline{root} user in the container is left empty. In Linux it is possible to disable a password (what should have happened) and to leave it blank. A disabled password cannot be used, but a blank password equals an empty input. This allows non-root users to gain root rights by supplying a blank password.

It is still possible to use the vulnerable images.

\subsubsection*{Side note about the CVSS score of CVE--2019--5021}

This vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.8 (and a 10 in CVSS 2)\footnote{\url{https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-5021}} out of a maximum score of 10. Such a high CVSS score means that this is considered an extremely high-risk vulnerability. But in actuality, this vulnerability is only risky in very specific cases.

An empty \lstinline{root} password sounds very dangerous, but it really is not that dangerous in an isolated environment (e.g.\ a container) that runs root by default. This vulnerability will only be dangerous in very specific cases.

For example, if we create a Docker image based on \lstinline{alpine:3.5} that uses a non-root user by default. If an attacker finds a way to execute code in the container, this vulnerability will allow them to escalate their privileges from the non-root user to \lstinline{root}, but the attacker will still need to find a way to escape the container. Begin able to execute code as \lstinline{root} will help them with escaping the container, but it does not guarantee it. This example shows that this vulnerability is dangerous, but only in a scenario where it is chained using other vulnerabilities.
