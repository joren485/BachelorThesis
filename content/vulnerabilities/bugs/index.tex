\section{Security Related Software Bugs}\label{section:bugs}
In this section we will look at security related bugs that have been found in the last few years. Although there have been many security related bugs found in the Docker ecosystem, not all of them have a large impact. Others are not fully publicly disclosed. We will look (from most recent to least recent) at recent, fully disclosed bugs that might be of use during a penetration test. In the \hyperref[appendix:CVE-List]{appendix} you will find a list of other less interesting Docker related bugs that were researched during this thesis.

The bugs we will look at are mostly useful in a container escape (\autoref{subsection:container-escape}). With the exception of CVE--2019--13139 (\autoref{CVE-2019-13139}) which can be useful in a Docker daemon attack (\autoref{attacker-model:daemon-attacks}).
