\section{Security Related Software Bugs}\label{section:bugs}
In this section we will look at security related bugs that have been found in the last few years. Although there have been many security related bugs found in the Docker ecosystem, not all of them have a large impact. Others are not fully publicly disclosed. We will look at recent, fully disclosed bugs that might be of use during a penetration test (from most recent to least recent). In the \hyperref[appendix:CVE-List]{appendix} you will find a list of other Docker related bugs I have looked at.

Each CVE is not immediately a complete container escape or other attack scenario. Most are useful during during an attack when used in combination with other vulnerabilities. For example by bypassing a protection mechanism.
However, some severe bugs are complete attacks. For example, CVE--2019--16884 (see \autoref{subsection:CVE-2019-16884}) is a container escape.

\medskip

Because there are many security researchers looking for bugs in containerization software, this section will likely become quickly outdated and as such should not be used as an inclusive list of important bugs.

All of the risk of these bugs can be prevented by using the latest version of Docker and Docker images. This is covered by CIS Docker Benchmark guidelines 1.1.2 (Ensure that the version of Docker is up to date) and 5.27 (Ensure that Docker commands always make use of the latest version of their image), respectively.

Because of these reasons, this section we will focus more on misconfigurations in \autoref{chapter:pentesting}.
