\subsection{Docker Daemon Attack}
If user permissions are incorrectly configured, an unprivileged user can access privileged resources using the Docker daemon. This is shown in \autoref{fig:docker-daemon-attack}.

Because Docker needs a lot of kernel features to function properly, the Docker daemon needs to run as \lstinline{root}. Because Docker has many (powerful) features, this allows any user with permissions to use Docker to gain \lstinline{root} privileges. This is why the Docker documentation explicitly states ``only trusted users should be allowed to control your Docker daemon''\footnote{\url{https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/}}.

\medskip

A real life example of the impact of incorrectly configured Docker permissions happened a few years back with one of the courses in the Computing Science curriculum (of the Radboud). A professor wanted to teach students about containerization and modern software development. The professor asked the IT department to install Docker on all student workstations and add all the students in the course to \lstinline{docker} group (giving them full permissions to run Docker). This gave every student the equivalent of \lstinline{root} rights on every workstation. This was a problem, because it allowed students to read sensitive information (e.g.\ private keys and \lstinline{/etc/shadow}) and make changes to the system.
