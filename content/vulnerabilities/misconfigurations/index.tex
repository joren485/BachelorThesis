\section{Misconfigurations}\label{section:misconfigurations}
In this section, we will take a look at misconfigurations of Docker and the impact those misconfigurations can have. For each misconfiguration, we will look at practical examples and the impact.

The first two misconfigurations we will look at (\autoref{subsection:docker-permissions} and \autoref{subsection:config-files}) are relevant to attacks that are performed on a host, Docker daemon attacks (\autoref{attacker-model:daemon-attacks}). The other misconfigurations are relevant to attacks that are performed from within a container, container escapes (\autoref{subsection:container-escape})

\medskip

We map each misconfiguration to relevant CIS Docker Benchmark guidelines (if any exist). We will see that the CIS Docker Benchmark does not cover all misconfigurations (see \autoref{subsubsection:setuid}, \autoref{subsection:config-files}, \autoref{subsubsection:remote-access} and \autoref{subsection:iptables}).
