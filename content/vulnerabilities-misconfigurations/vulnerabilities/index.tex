\section{Vulnerabilities}\label{section:vulnerabilities}
In this section we will look at vulnerabilities that have been found in the last years. Although there have been many vulnerabilities found in the Docker ecosystem, not all of them have a large impact. Others are not fully publicly disclosed. We will look some recent, fully disclosed vulnerabilities that might be of use during a penetration test. In the \hyperref[appendix:CVE-List]{appendix} you can find a list of all other Docker related vulnerabilities I have looked at.

All of these vulnerabilities can be prevented by using the latest version of Docker and Docker images. This is covered by guidelines 1.1.2 (Ensure that the version of Docker is up to date) and 5.27 (Ensure that Docker commands always make use of the latest version of their image), respectively.
