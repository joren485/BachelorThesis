\subsection{CVE--2018--15664}
A bug was found in Docker 18.06.1-ce-rc1 that allows processes in containers to read and write files on the host\cite{CVE-2018-15664-Openwall}\cite{CVE-2018-15664-Bugzilla}. There is enough time between the checking if a symlink is linked to a safe path (within the container) and the actual using of the symlink, that the symlink can be pointed to another file in the mean time. This allows a container to start by reading or writing a symlink to a arbitrary non-relevant file in the container, but actually read or write a file on the host.
