\chapter{Attack Surface \& Attack Models}\label{chapter:attack-surface-models}
\todo[inline]{Improve models a lot}
Because Docker is more of an ecosystem than a single process, it has quite a large attack surface. This attack surface consists of multiple attacker models.

\medskip

In this chapter we will look at three distinct attacker models. The first two, container escapes (\autoref{subsection:container-escape}) and container-to-container attacks (\autoref{attacker-model:container-to-container-attacks}), are attacker models from inside a container. The last, Docker daemon attacks (\autoref{attacker-model:daemon-attacks}), is on a host that runs Docker.

\medskip

To clarify the attacker models, we will look at images showing each. We see the following processes pictured in the images.
\begin{enumerate}[A.]
    \item A standard (privileged) process running directly on the host.
    \item A standard unprivileged process running directly on the host.
    \item A process running in a Docker container.
    \item Similar to C.
\end{enumerate}
