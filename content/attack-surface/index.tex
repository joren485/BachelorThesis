\chapter{Attack Surface \& Models}\label{section:attack-surface-models}
\todo[inline]{Introduction}
Because Docker is more of an ecosystem than a single process, it has quite a large attack surface. This attack surface consists of multiple attacker models.

\medskip

Let's take a look at the following scenarios and images showing the attacker models.
We see the following processes pictured in the images.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[A)] Standard (privileged) process running directly on the host.
    \item[B)] Standard unprivileged process running directly on the host.
    \item[C)] Process running in a Docker container.
    \item[D)] Similar to C.
\end{enumerate}
