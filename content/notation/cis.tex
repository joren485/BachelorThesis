The Center for Internet Security (or CIS for short) is a non-profit organization that provides best practice solutions for digital security. For example, they provide security hardened virtual machine images that are configured for optimal security.

\medskip

The CIS Benchmarks are guidelines and best practices on security on many different types of software. These guidelines are freely available for anyone and can be found on their site\footnote{\url{https://cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/}}. Many companies (e.g. Secura) use the CIS Benchmarks as a baseline to assess the security of systems.

\medskip

They also provide guidelines on Docker\footnote{Only the community edition (Docker CE). It does not cover the enterprise edition (Docker EE).}. The latest version (1.2.0) contains 115 guidelines. These are sorted by topic (e.g. Docker daemon and configuration files). In \hyperref[appendix:CIS-Benchmark-Example]{the appendix} you will find an example guideline from the latest Docker CIS Benchmark.
