In \autoref{chapter:vulnerabilities} we looked at specific attacker models and individual vulnerabilities. In this chapter we will look at what penetration testing is and how we identify the vulnerabilities we looked at during a penetration test. We will first look at how to identify them manually. After that, we will look at available tools that will help us automate part of that process.
