\chapter{Penetration Testing of Docker}\label{chapter:pentesting}
\todo[inline]{Document design decisions/process}

In \autoref{chapter:vulnerabilities} we looked at specific attacker models, individual vulnerabilities and individual misconfigurations. In this chapter we will look at how we would use those during a penetration test. We will first look at how to use them manually. After that, we will look at how we can automate the manual steps.
