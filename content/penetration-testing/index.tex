\chapter{Penetration Testing of Docker}\label{chapter:pentesting}
In \autoref{chapter:vulnerabilities} we looked at specific vulnerabilities. In this chapter we will look at how we identify those vulnerabilities during a penetration test. We will first look at how to identify them manually. After that, we will look at available tools that will help us automate part of that process.

\medskip

In \autoref{chapter:checklist} we will combine the information from \autoref{chapter:vulnerabilities} and this chapter into a checklist.
