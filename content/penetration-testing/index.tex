\chapter{Penetration Testing of Docker}\label{chapter:pentesting}
In \autoref{chapter:vulnerabilities} we discuss specific vulnerabilities. Before we can exploit those vulnerabilities, we first need to perform reconnaissance on the target system to gather data. This data can then be used to identify weak spots and vulnerabilities. This chapter will focus on gathering that interesting data and identifying those vulnerabilities.

In \autoref{section:identify-vulnerabilities} we focus on how to do this manually for both perspectives of \autoref{chapter:attack-surface-models}. In \autoref{section:tools} we will look at available tools that will help us automate part of assessments.

In \autoref{chapter:checklist} we will combine the information from \autoref{chapter:vulnerabilities} and this chapter into a checklist.
