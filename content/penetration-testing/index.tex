\chapter{Penetration Testing of Docker}\label{chapter:pentesting}
In \autoref{chapter:vulnerabilities-misconfigurations} we looked at specific attacker models, individual vulnerabilities and individual misconfigurations. In this chapter we will look at how we would use those during a penetration test. We will first look at how to use them manually. After that, we will look at how we can automate the manual steps.

\hfill

We will mostly focus on the misconfigurations, because although the vulnerabilities might have a high impact they are all mitigated with one line of advice: ``Keep your systems up to date''.
