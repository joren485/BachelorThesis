\subsection{Penetration Testing on a Host Running Docker}\label{subsection:testing-host}
When testing a host system with Docker installed on it, we are interested in bugs and misconfigurations that allow us to use Docker to access sensitive data or escalate our privileges within the system. In this section we will look at different steps we can take to gather information about the system and the configuration of Docker. This will tell us if it is possible to perform a Docker daemon (see \autoref{attacker-model:daemon-attacks}).
