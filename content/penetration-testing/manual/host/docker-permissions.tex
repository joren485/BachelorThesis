\subsubsection{Who is allowed to use Docker?}
Docker permissions are defined by the permission bits on the Docker socket (i.e.\ \lstinline{/var/run/docker.sock}). By default, the owner (\lstinline{root}) and the group (\lstinline{docker}) have read and write permissions. Meaning that \lstinline{root} and every user in the \lstinline{docker} group are allowed to interact with the Docker socket.

We can see who is in the \lstinline{docker} group by looking in \lstinline{/etc/group}.
\begin{lstlisting}
$ grep docker /etc/group
docker:x:999:jvrancken
\end{lstlisting}
We see that only \lstinline{jvrancken} is part of the \lstinline{docker} group. It might also be interesting to look at which users have \lstinline{sudo} rights (in \lstinline{/etc/sudoers}). Users without \lstinline{sudo} but with Docker permissions still need to be considered \lstinline{sudo} users (see \autoref{subsection:docker-permissions}).

\hfill

It is possible that the Docker socket has permissions that give anybody permission to interact with Docker. Some people set the permissions to \lstinline{666} (i.e.\ read and write for all users). Giving all users read and write permission to the Docker socket allows them to use Docker.

\hfill

It is also possible that the \lstinline{setuid} bit is set on the Docker client. In that case, we are also able to use Docker (as the owner of the Docker client).

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Permissions without and wit the \lstinline{setuid} bit.},captionpos=b]
(host)$ ls -l $(which docker)
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 88965248 nov 13 08:28 /usr/bin/docker
(host)# chmod +s $(which docker)
(host)$ ls -l $(which docker)
-rwsr-sr-x 1 root root 88965248 nov 13 08:28 /usr/bin/docker
\end{lstlisting}
