\subsection{Detect If We Are Running in a Container}\label{subsection:detection}
In most security assessments and penetration tests it will be clear what kind of system (i.e.\ running inside a container or not) we are attacking. In some cases, however, it might not be. A good example of this, is finding a remote code execution vulnerability on a system during a black box penetration test. This allows us to execute arbitrary commands on a system that we know nothing about. In such a case it is important to know if we are running in a Docker container or not.

\medskip

In this section, we will look at steps that show us whether we are in a Docker container. These steps are in descending order of ease and certainty. If we know we are inside a container, we can perform reconnaissance inside the container (see \autoref{subsection:testing-container}). If we know we are not running inside a container, we can perform reconnaissance on the host (see \autoref{subsection:testing-host}).
