\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\lstinline{/.dockerenv}}{/.dockerenv}}
\lstinline{/.dockerenv} is a file that is present in all Docker containers. It was used in the past by LXC to load the environment variables in the container. Currently it is always empty, because LXC is not used anymore. However, it is still (officially) used to identify containers\cite{Metasploit-Linux-Gather-Container-Detection}\cite{Removed-Dockerinit-Reference}.
