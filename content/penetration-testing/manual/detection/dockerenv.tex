\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\lstinline{/.dockerenv}}{/.dockerenv}}
\lstinline{/.dockerenv} is a file that is present in all Docker containers. It was used in the past by LXC\footnote{LXC used to be the engine that Docker used to create containers. It has now been replaced with \lstinline{containerd}.} to load the environment variables in the container. Currently it is always empty, because LXC is not used anymore. However, it is still (officially) used to identify whether a process is running in a Docker container\cite{Metasploit-Linux-Gather-Container-Detection}\cite{Removed-Dockerinit-Reference}.
