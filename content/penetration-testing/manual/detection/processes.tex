\subsubsection{Running Processes}
Containers are made to run one process. Host systems run many processes. All these processes have one root process (with process id 1) to start all necessary processes. On most Linux systems that process is either \lstinline{init} or \lstinline{systemd}. You would never see \lstinline{init} or \lstinline{systemd} in a container, because the container only runs one process not a full operating system. That is why the amount of processes and the process with pid 1 is a good indicator whether we are running in a container.
