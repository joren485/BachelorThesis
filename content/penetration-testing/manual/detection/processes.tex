\subsubsection{Running Processes}
Containers are made to run one process, while host systems run many processes. Processes on host systems have one \lstinline{root} process (with process id 1) to start all necessary (child) processes. On most Linux systems that process is either \lstinline{init} or \lstinline{systemd}. You would never see \lstinline{init} or \lstinline{systemd} in a container, because the container only runs one process and not not a full operating system. That is why the amount of processes and the process with pid 1 is a good indicator whether we are running in a container.
