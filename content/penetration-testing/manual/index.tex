In \autoref{chapter:vulnerabilities} we focussed on the individual vulnerabilities and misconfigurations and how to exploit them. In this section we will focus on how to identify them. Before we do that, we will look at how to see whether you are in a container or not.

We will mostly focus on the misconfigurations, because although the vulnerabilities might have a high impact they are all mitigated with one line of advice: ``Keep your systems up to date''. Finding vulnerabilities is also a lot easier than misconfigurations, because almost all Docker vulnerabilities are dependent on the version of Docker being out of date.

We will look at all the attack scenarios described in \autoref{section:attack-surface-models}.
