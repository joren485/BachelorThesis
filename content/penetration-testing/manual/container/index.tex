\subsection{Testing from Container}
If we have code execution inside of a container, we are going to focus on escaping. Because the Docker daemon runs as \lstinline{root}, we will most likely get \lstinline{root} access to the host if we escape. We will take a look at steps we can take to identify the container operating system, the container image, the host operating system and weak spots in the container.

Many Docker images are stripped from unnecessary tools, binaries and libraries to make the image smaller. However, we might need those tools during a penetration test. If we are \lstinline{root} in a container, we are most likely able to install the necessary tooling. If we only have access to a non-\lstinline{root} user, it might not be possible to install anything. In that case, we will have to work with what is available to us or find a way to get statically compiled binaries inside the container.
