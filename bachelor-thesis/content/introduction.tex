The introduction of your bachelor thesis introduces the research area, the
research hypothesis, and the scientific contributions of your work.
A good narrative structure is the one suggested by Simon Peyton Jones
\cite{peys04:HowToWriteAGoodResearchPaper}:
%
\begin{itemize}
\item describe the problem / research question
\item motivate why this problem must be solved
\item demonstrate that a (new) solution is needed
\item explain the intuition behind your solution
\item motivate why / how your solution solves the problem (this is technical)
\item explain how it compares with related work
\end{itemize}
%
Close the introduction with a paragraph in which the content of the next chapters
is briefly mentioned (one sentence per chapter).
