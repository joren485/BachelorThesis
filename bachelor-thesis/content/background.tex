\section{CIS Benchmarks}
The Center for Internet Security (or CIS for short) is a non-profit organization that provides best practice solutions for digital security. For example, they provide security hardened virtual machine images that are configured for optimal security.
The CIS Benchmarks are guidelines and best practices on security on many different types of software. These guidelines are freely available for anyone and can be found on their site\footnote{\url{https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/}}.

\hfill
They also provide guidelines on Docker\footnote{\url{https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/docker/}}. In \hyperref[appendix:a]{the appendix} you will find an example CIS benchmark taken from the latest CIS benchmarks.
